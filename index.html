    <h2>MOTIVATION</h2>
    <p id="motivationtext">As a graduated philosopher, I want to learn a technical skill that can help me embody my ideas and aspirations in the job market. Over the years I have been learning coding in my spare time, solving coding challenges on projecteuler.  I would like to take it one step further and make it into my main occupation. My interest in IT has always been present through this pull towards the intricate structures from coding clubs at a young age as play, to digital desgin technology in art school and even more seriously  in my recent work experience at Accenture. I think coding is an important skill not only for employment, but also to understand and shape this digitalised world, and be able to use, administer or regulate technology.  </p>
    <p id="motivationtext">I specifically want to learn this skill at Founders&Coders, because the framework of learning at F&C resonates with my preferred learning methods. Here peer-learning, solidarity, and service to the non-profit community are core values. I identify with these values and methods. </p>
    <p id="motivationtext">Both in my Bachelor at University College Utrecht, and in my Research Master program of Philosophy at the University of Amsterdam, I engaged in peer learning. The discussions in the Bachelor were often led by the students who had prepared a topic with the professor not professing, but aiding the learning process and giving context when necessary. In the philosophy studies this was even more pronounced, as in this field the questions asked and approaches taken hardly ever are univocal; there is not one right answer. The classes were often discussions of papers where the students were grappling with the contents. Furthermore, I want to learn in a diverse environment because interdisciplinary and intercultural experiences have always been fruitful in my experiences of studying as well working on various projects. </p>
    <p id="motivationtext">In 2015 I joined The Study Road biking from Istanbul to Beijing. I was the only experienced travel cyclist, as I had made some similar trips before.  During the first weeks I shared my knowledge of fixing bikes and organising the routes with the team until we became equals in these matters and started confronting problems together.  Sharing what I know with others gives me joy and satisfaction as well as makes me realize the gaps in my knowledge and helps me practice being clear in explanations and quick on my feet to take the lead under pressure. </p>
    <p id="motivationtext">Philosophy taught me there is not one right answer and that interpretation needs to be done charitably. In coding the set of answers might be more restricted but a similar adagio holds. There is not one correct way to do something and especially while learning, there are various ways to approach things. The exposure to the different viewpoints is the key value of a peer learning system.</p>
    <p id="motivationtext">Furthermore, the peer learning and the lack of fees seems to me to make it possible for us to develop our skills in an environment where uniformising pressures of corporate culture are held at bay a little longer. I think this is important as creativity and solidarity might spring new ideas and energies that will drive us further and in directions yet unexplored.</p>
    <p id="motivationtext">Lastly, I want to lay down roots in London. Learning together with peers and moving into the network that Founders&Coders has is an opportunity to establish myself. I am looking forward to working together, to learn a new skill, to make friends, and to orient myself on meaningful employment.</p>

      <p>I love to go to museums and get inspired by modern art. For me it is one way to see different viewpoints on this shared world. The objects mediate and make this possible. An example is the harrowing work by Egon Schiele, which captures the broken spirit of this world in his drawings and paintings in striking ways. <br/>(Navigate the pictures with the arrow keys or press the arrows.)</p>
