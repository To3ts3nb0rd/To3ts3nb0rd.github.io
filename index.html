    <h2>MOTIVATION</h2>
    <p id="motivationtext">As a graduated philosopher, I want to learn a technical skill that can help me in the job market. Over the years I have been coming back to coding in my spare time, solving coding challenges on projecteuler. It is time to make a choice for my future and that is that I want to learn coding. My interest in IT has always been present through this pull towards coding from a young age and in my recent work experience at Accenture. I think coding is an important skill not only for employment, but also to understand and shape this digitalised world. 
    I specifically want to learn this skill at Founders&Coders, because I am inspired by the framework of learning at F&C. Here peer-learning, solidarity, and service to the non-profit community, are core values. I identify with these values and methods and below I will explain why that is.
    Furthermore, I want to learn in a diverse and inspiring environment. Where I can learn from other people's experiences and viewpoints. And where I can share my knowledge and background, acquired through studying philosophy and economics, creative experiences in art school, and traveling and intercultural experiences. </p>
    <p id="motivationtext">The peer learning is a style of learning that fits well with my learning. Both in my Bachelor at University College Utrecht, and in my Research Master Philosophy at the University of Amsterdam, I engaged in peer learning. The discussion in the Bachelor were often led by the students who had prepared a topic with the professor not professing, but aiding the learning process and giving context when necessary. In a philosophy studies this is even more pronounced, as the questions asked and approaches taken hardly ever are univocal; there is not one right answer. The classes were often discussions of papers where the students are grappling with the contents.</p>
    <p id="motivationtext">In 2015 I joined The Study Road biking from Istanbul to Beijing. I was the only experienced travel cyclist, as I had made some smaller trips before. This knowledge of fixing bikes, and traveling I shared with the team in the first weeks after which we became equals in these matters and started confronting problems together. This is to say that I enjoy sharing that which I know and it gives me joy to do that and to see others get what I already do get. </p>
    <p id="motivationtext">When confronted with a problem, my style is to reflect, let it rest and chew on it. This is by training as a philosopher, but also a character trait. This is still but one perspective that develops over time. In cooperation with others -this is also the experience I had in the UCU classroom and in my philosophy studies- many valuable insights come from different perspectives that I could not see by myself. The teacher might be some kind of authority on the matter, which is important to take into account due to the extensive amount of experience behind this person. However, that is not the end all and be all. It is not possible to encompass all experience in one person.</p>
    <p id="motivationtext">Furthermore, the peer learning and the lack of fees seems to me to make it possible for us to develop our skills in an environment where uniformising pressures of corporate culture are held at bay a little longer. I think this is important as creativity and solidarity might spring new ideas and energies that will drive us further and in directions yet unexplored.</p>
    <p id="motivationtext">Lastly, I want to lay down roots in London. Learning together with peers and moving into the network that Founders&Coders has is an opportunity to establish myself. I am looking forward to working together, to learn a new skill, to make friends, and to orient myself on meaningful employment.</p>

      <p>I love to go to the museum and get inspired by modern art. The harrowing work by Egon Schiele, which captures the broken spirit of this world in his drawings and paintings, strikes me every time. <br/>(Navigate the pictures with the arrow keys or press the arrows.)</p>
